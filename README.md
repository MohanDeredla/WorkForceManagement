\##  Bug Fixes

\###  Bug 1: Task Re-assignment Creates Duplicates



\*\*Issue\*\*: When reassigning tasks by reference, old tasks remained active, causing duplicates.



\*\*Fix\*\*: Updated `assignByReference()` to:

\- Cancel previous tasks (`status = CANCELLED`)

\- Only assign one active task to the new assignee.



\*\*Before\*\*:

\- Multiple tasks with same `referenceId`, `taskType`, and active status.



\*\*After\*\*:

\- Only one active task for the assignee, others cancelled.



---



\### Bug 2: Cancelled Tasks Clutter the View



\*\*Issue\*\*: Date-based task fetch returned cancelled tasks.



\*\*Fix\*\*: Modified date filtering logic to exclude tasks with `status = CANCELLED`.
